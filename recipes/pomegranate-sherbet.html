    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>TA welcome surprise after a heavy meal, this make-ahead sherbet requires very little lift. Gelatin and cream are the secret weapons for a super-creamy scoop. Feeling extra fancy? Serve it with fresh mint and shortbread cookies, such as Speculoos.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups unsweetened pomegranate juice</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 dash salt</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup cold water</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) envelope unflavored gelatin</li>
        <li>1 cup chilled whipping cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir together pomegranate juice, sugar, lemon juice, and salt in a large bowl. Chill, covered, 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Put the cold water in a small saucepan and sprinkle with gelatin; let stand 1 minute. Cook, stirring, over low heat just until gelatin dissolves, about 2 minutes. Stir into pomegranate mixture. Add cream; beat with an electric hand mixer at medium speed until mixture is foamy, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Freeze in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's directions until sherbet reaches soft-serve consistency, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a 1- or 2-qt. freezer-safe container. Put a piece of plastic wrap directly on surface; cover and freeze at least 2 hours or up to 1 month.</li>
    </ol>
